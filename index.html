        <ul>
          <li>- Coding. (Python and Java are my strongest languages but I dabble in C/C++, Haskell and Scheme)</li>
          <li>- Android Development. I developed the android version of <a href="https://www.eventfire.co/"><b>EventFire</b></a>.</li>
          <li>- Science. For Progress!!</li>
          <li>- Music. I love music, and I play guitar and piano pretty well.</li>
          <li>- Sport. I used to be a pretty competitive rower, but its hard to find time for that now. I still like to keep fit though.</li>
